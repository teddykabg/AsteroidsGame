Description:
The player controls a spaceship which can move around the screen. The spaceship has to avoid
the asteroids that pop up in the screen, and can destroy them by shooting at them, at which
point they split into smaller asteroids. each asteroid has a chance of having an enemy spaceship
inside. when freed by destroying the asteroid, it flies around and tries to shoot the player.
(+ asteroids might also sometimes drop bonuses like heal or different weapons)

Speed of asteroids is kept constant (or can slowly decrease to a given lower bound).
Speed of ships decreases towards zero, propelling forward will sharply increase it.

Elements:
player: position (+ hp, ammo and weapon type)
asteroid: position, speed, design
enemy: an instance of player controlled by AI
hud: score (+ hp / ammo count and type)
(+ weapon)
missile: position, speed, time to live (decreases each frame before missile disappears)

Controls:
Turn L/R, Thrust forward, Shoot (+ change weapon)

AI:
flies in the direction of the player, keeps some distance, in random intervals fires its weapon
at the players current location

Graphics:
Black background, asteroids as white outlines, ship as white lines assembled in a ship-like pattern
Propelling will cause more lines to appear behind the ship, these could be animated
Shots are simple short lines/dots
Can be made from shapes programatically or as bitmaps (objects arent rectangular and bmp doesnt
allow for transparency - issues with bounding boxes and rendering, but these might only be small
and not noticeable)

Filesystem:
Highscore tables (Name:score) are kept in a file and shown on main screen
(+ serialize and deserialize levels as json)

Optional ideas:
More enemy variants
JSON


Collisions: default - iterate over all objects, optional - collision array with local resolution
